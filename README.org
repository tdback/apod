By default ~apod~ will extract and download the current day's APOD and save it to the local file system. You can optionally specify an alternate filename for the downloaded image, otherwise ~apod~ will use the extracted filename.

If you are using ~nix~, you can run the script with ~nix run~:
#+begin_src shell
  nix run git+https://codeberg.org/tdback/apod
#+end_src

* Requirements
The script relies on the following python3 libraries, which can be installed via ~pip~:
#+begin_src shell
  pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
#+end_src

If you are using ~nix~, you can create an executable with the following command:
#+begin_src shell
  nix build
#+end_src

The generated executable can be found in =./result/bin/=.
